Let’s start our journey with the history as every story 1.1 What is cryptogrphy There is such an exact definition for the cryptography. Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. - Wikipeida Cryptography is technique of securing information and communications through use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it. -GeeksforGeeks Website Thus we can conclude that Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and receiver to view its contents ( third party can not understand the message. 1.2 History First evidence of cryptography found in the Egypt. An artist pa 1.3 Sherlock Holmes and the Adventure of the Dancing Men The adventure of dancing men is one of the story of the “The Return of Sherlock Holmes” by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In that story Mr. Sherlock Holmes had to break a cipher. “Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was a page torn from a note book. The markings were done in pencil, and ran in this way”: 1.4 Some Key Ideas Privacy: Keep information secret Data Integrity: Data had been not changed Authentication/Identification Person Message Signature Authorization Validation Access control Non-repudiation 1.5 Cryptographic Goals Confidentiality (privacy) Data Integrity (prevent unauthorized alteration of data Authentication Non-repudiation 1.6 How can we achieve any of these goals? Consider sending a confidential message What features do we need? What challenges and what limitations do we have? 1.7 Example Consider choosing a secret alphabet. Pigpen Cipher Express your name using this. Decode the following message. Advantages/Disadvantages? What about adversaries?

It is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. The DH algorithm enable two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure public channel. This established key can be used to symmetric-key algorithms for future communication. Since symmetric key algorithms are more efficient than asymmetric keys algorithms, the DH key exchange method is very useful.

Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 7.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
