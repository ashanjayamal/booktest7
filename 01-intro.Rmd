# Deffie-Helman Algorithm (Diffe-Helamn Key Distribution Algorithm)
The Diffie-Helamn (DH) Algorithm is a key exchange protocol. It is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. The DH algorithm enable two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure public channel. This established key can be used to symmetric-key algorithms for future communication. Since symmetric key algorithms are more efficient than asymmetric keys algorithms, the DH key exchange method is very useful.
