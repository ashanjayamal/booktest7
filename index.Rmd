# Introduction
In this book you can basic idea about the role of mathematics behind the Cryptography. Let's start our journey with the history as every story

## What is cryptogrphy
There is such an exact definition for the cryptography. 

> Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. 
> - Wikipeida 

> Cryptography is technique of securing information and communications through use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it. 
> -GeeksforGeeks Website

Thus we can conclude that __Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and receiver  to view its contents ( third party can not understand the message.__

## History 
First evidence of cryptography found in the Egypt. An artist pa



## Sherlock Holmes and the  Adventure of the Dancing Men
The adventure of dancing men is one of the story of the "The Return of Sherlock Holmes" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In that story Mr. Sherlock Holmes had to break a cipher.

_"Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was a page torn from a note book. The markings were done in pencil, and ran in this way":_



## Some Key Ideas
* Privacy: Keep information secret
* Data Integrity: Data had been not changed
* Authentication/Identification
  + Person
  + Message
* Signature
* Authorization
* Validation
* Access control
* Non-repudiation

## Cryptographic Goals
* Confidentiality (privacy)
* Data Integrity (prevent unauthorized alteration of data
* Authentication
* Non-repudiation

## How can we achieve any of these goals?
Consider sending  a confidential message

* What features do we need?
* What challenges and what limitations do we have?

## Example
Consider choosing a secret alphabet.
