# Introduction
In this book you can basic idea about the role of mathematics behind the Cryptography. Let's start our journey with the history as every story

## What is cryptogrphy
There is such an exact definition for the cryptography. 

> Cryptography, or cryptology is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior. 
> - Wikipeida 

> Cryptography is technique of securing information and communications through use of codes so that only those person for whom the information is intended can understand it and process it. 
> -GeeksforGeeks Website

Thus we can conclude that __Cryptography is the study of secure communications techniques that allow only the sender and receiver  to view its contents ( third party can not understand the message.__

## History 
First evidence of cryptography found in the Egypt. An artist pa



## Sherlock Holmes and the  Adventure of the Dancing Men
The adventure of dancing men is one of the story of the "The Return of Sherlock Holmes" by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In that story Mr. Sherlock Holmes had to break a cipher.

_"Holmes held up the paper so that the sunlight shone full upon it. It was a page torn from a note book. The markings were done in pencil, and ran in this way":_



## Some Key Ideas
* Privacy: Keep information secret
* Data Integrity: Data had been not changed
* Authentication/Identification
  + Person
  + Message
* Signature
* Authorization
* Validation
* Access control
* Non-repudiation

## Cryptographic Goals
* Confidentiality (privacy)
* Data Integrity (prevent unauthorized alteration of data
* Authentication
* Non-repudiation

## How can we achieve any of these goals?
Consider sending  a confidential message

* What features do we need?
* What challenges and what limitations do we have?

## Example
Consider choosing a secret alphabet.

# Deffie-Helman Algorithm (Diffe-Helamn Key Distribution Algorithm)

The Diffie-Helamn (DH) Algorithm is a key exchange protocol. It is a method of securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public channel. The DH algorithm enable two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure public channel. This established key can be used to symmetric-key algorithms for future communication. Since symmetric key algorithms are more efficient than asymmetric keys algorithms, the DH key exchange method is very useful.

## ! Think {.unnumbered}

Alice and Bob needs to filp a coin. But they can not be at the same place. They can do it with telephone. But both of them do not trust other party.

1.  How do they flip a coin over the phone?

2.  How do they grantee that other one is not cheating?

They can come up with a following kind of protocol. This method is called "General Coin Flipping Over Telephone". **Steps**

1. Define a function $f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$ with the following properties. 
*For every integer x, it is easy to compute f(x) from x, while given any value f(x) it is impossible (hard) to find any information about a pre-image x, e.g., whether x is an odd or even number.*
2. Then Alice and Bob agrees on 
* A function $f:\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}$  with properties as specified
* An even number ($x$ or $f(x)$) represents HEADS and an odd number represents TAILS with properties as specified.
3. Coin Tossing
Alice: Picks a large random integer $x$ and computes $f(x)$, she reads $f(x)$ to Bob over the phone;
Bob  : Tells Alice, his guess of $x$ as even or odd.
Alice: Reads $x$ to bob; 
Bob  : Verifies $f(x)$ and sees the correctness/incorrectness of his guess.

1)?
2)?


## Steps (Edit it correctly)
1. Choose $G$lobal $P$arameters.
$P$ is $P$rime number
$G$ is $P$rime number such that $G$ < $P$
2. $P$rivate key $G$eneration
* $P$erson 1 and 2 choose their $P$rivate key.
$P$erson 1 $P$rivate key : a (a < $P$) 
$P$erson 2 $P$rivate key : b (b < $P$) 
3. $P$ublic key $G$eneration.
* Then they calculate $P$ublic key as follows,
$P$erson 1 : A = $G$
a(mod $P$) 
$P$erson 2 : B = $G$
b (mod $P$) 
4. Then they exchan$G$e their $P$rivate key.
5. Calculatin$G$ secret key.
$P$erson 1 secret key : s = B a (mod $P$)

# Cross-references {#cross}

Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book.

## Chapters and sub-chapters

There are two steps to cross-reference any heading:

1. Label the heading: `# Hello world {#nice-label}`. 
    - Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, `# Hello world` = `# Hello world {#hello-world}`.
    - To label an un-numbered heading, use: `# Hello world {-#nice-label}` or `{# Hello world .unnumbered}`.

1. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using `\@ref(nice-label)`; for example, please see Chapter \@ref(cross). 
    - If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: [any text you want can go here](#cross).

## Captioned figures and tables

Figures and tables *with captions* can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using `\@ref(fig:chunk-label)` and `\@ref(tab:chunk-label)`, respectively.

See Figure \@ref(fig:nice-fig).

```{r nice-fig, fig.cap='Here is a nice figure!', out.width='80%', fig.asp=.75, fig.align='center', fig.alt='Plot with connected points showing that vapor pressure of mercury increases exponentially as temperature increases.'}
par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1))
plot(pressure, type = 'b', pch = 19)
```

Don't miss Table \@ref(tab:nice-tab).

```{r nice-tab, tidy=FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  head(pressure, 10), caption = 'Here is a nice table!',
  booktabs = TRUE
)
```

# Basic Observations

You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. 

Add a numbered part: `# (PART) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an unnumbered part: `# (PART\*) Act one {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`)

Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: `# (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-}` (followed by `# A chapter`). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.




<!--chapter:end:03-parts.Rmd-->

# Footnotes and citations 

## Footnotes

Footnotes are put inside the square brackets after a caret `^[]`. Like this one ^[This is a footnote.]. 

## Citations

Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using `@key`.

For example, we are using the **bookdown** package [@R-bookdown] (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and **knitr** [@xie2015] (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). 
Note that the `.bib` files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML `bibliography` key.


The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: <https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations>

# Sharing your book

## Publishing

HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html

## 404 pages

By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you'd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a `_404.Rmd` or `_404.md` file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax.

## Metadata for sharing

Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the `index.Rmd` YAML. To setup, set the `url` for your book and the path to your `cover-image` file. Your book's `title` and `description` are also used.



This `gitbook` uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same.

Specify your book's source repository on GitHub using the `edit` key under the configuration options in the `_output.yml` file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter's source file. 

Read more about the features of this output format here:

https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown/reference/gitbook.html

Or use:

```{r eval=FALSE}
?bookdown::gitbook
```

# EXpress my sorry to Little bunny

I am very sorry about what happen yesterday. You pinch me and It hurt me. So I shouted.
How ever i am very sorry about it. So Please forgive me.
